This directory contains the .cfg files and spatial databases needed to run
the benchmark. The simulations may either be run using the shell scripts
or by running the commands contained in the scripts. This will take the
form:
pylith MMMM.cfg fault_lockDD.cfg solmeth.cfg MMMM_lockDD_tau0-X.cfg

The MMMM represents the type of mesh (hex8 or tet4), the DD represents the
locking depth (20 or 40 km), the X represents the ratio of earthquake
recurrence time to Maxwell time (tau0), and solmeth refers to the type of
linear solution (asm or fieldsplit).

The parameters common to all simulations are contained in pylithapp.cfg.
Additional .cfg files are:

Mesh-specific:	
	hex8.cfg:	Hexahedral mesh with one level of uniform
			refinement near the mesh center.
	tet4.cfg:	Tetrahedral mesh that is graded from the center to
			the outer edges.

Fault locking:
	fault_lock20.cfg:	Specifies parameters for a locking depth of
				20 km.
	fault_lock40.cfg:	Specifies parameters for a locking depth of
				40 km.

Solution method:
	asm.cfg:	Use the generic ASM solution method.
	fieldsplit.cfg:	Use the field split method with a custom
			preconditioner.

Problem-specific:
	hex8_lock20_tau0-1.cfg:	Use hex mesh with 20 km locking depth and
				tau0 value of 1.
	hex8_lock20_tau0-2.cfg:	Use hex mesh with 20 km locking depth and
				tau0 value of 2.
	hex8_lock40_tau0-1.cfg:	Use hex mesh with 40 km locking depth and
				tau0 value of 1.
	hex8_lock40_tau0-2.cfg:	Use hex mesh with 40 km locking depth and
				tau0 value of 2.
	tet4_lock20_tau0-1.cfg:	Use tet mesh with 20 km locking depth and
				tau0 value of 1.
	tet4_lock20_tau0-2.cfg:	Use tet mesh with 20 km locking depth and
				tau0 value of 2.
	tet4_lock40_tau0-1.cfg:	Use tet mesh with 40 km locking depth and
				tau0 value of 1.
	tet4_lock40_tau0-2.cfg:	Use tet mesh with 40 km locking depth and
				tau0 value of 2.
				
The spatial databases used are:
Elastic material:
	mat_elastic.spatialdb:	Uniform elastic properties consistent with
				lambda = mu = 30 GPa.

Viscoelastic material:
	mat_maxwell_tau0-1.spatialdb:	Uniform viscoelastic properties
					consistent with a Maxwell time of
					200 years (tau0 = 1).
	mat_maxwell_tau0-2.spatialdb:	Uniform viscoelastic properties
					consistent with a Maxwell time of
					100 years (tau0 = 2).

Fault rupture:
	finalslip_rupture_lock20.spatialdb:	Fault rupture parameters for
						a locking depth of 20 km.
	finalslip_rupture_lock40.spatialdb:	Fault rupture parameters for
						a locking depth of 40 km.

Fault creep:
	sliprate_creep_lock20.spatialdb:	Fault creep parameters for a
						locking depth of 20 km.
	sliprate_creep_lock40.spatialdb:	Fault creep parameters for a
						locking depth of 40 km.

Slip time:
	sliptime.spatialdb:	Slip initial time for all fault sources.

Shell scripts are provided for convenience, to supply all the necessary
.cfg files to PyLith for each simulation. The names correspond to the
problem-specific .cfg files listed above.

Once a problem has run, there will be a number of HDF5 files (*.h5) in the
corresponding output directory (../results/MMMM_lockDD_tau0-X), along with
XDMF files (*.xmf) that describe the contents of the HDF5 files. The XDMF
files may be used with visualization packages such as ParaView. There are
also some postprocessing utilities in the utils directory.
