This is a simple benchmark that demonstrates how to model a buried dike.
The dike has dimensions of 24 km wide by 12 km, and the top edge lies at
6 km depth. A uniform opening of 3 m is applied, which will taper to zero
between the inner dike boundary (2 km from the dike edge) and the dike edge.
We provide both tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes to solve the problem.
The hexahedral mesh is graded by first creating a uniform resolution mesh and
by then refining an inner volume. The tetrahedral mesh is graded by setting
a constant mesh size on the dike itself (2 km resolution) and a constant mesh
size of 6 km on the outer boundaries.

To run the benchmarks, first generate the meshes by running Cubit/Trelis using
the mesh_hex8_graded_2000m.jou and mesh_tet4_graded_2000m.jou journal files.
The simulations may be run from within the parameters directory:

pylith dike-disloc_hex8.cfg dike-disloc_hex8_graded_2000m.cfg -nodes=<np>
pylith dike-disloc_tet4.cfg dike-disloc_tet4_graded_2000m.cfg -nodes=<np>

The np parameter is the number of processors on which to run.

Time-dependent versions of the simulations (10 years with 0.1 year time steps)
may be run by simply appending the timedep.cfg filename to the command line:

pylith dike-disloc_hex8.cfg dike-disloc_hex8_graded_2000m.cfg timedep.cfg -nodes=<np>
pylith dike-disloc_tet4.cfg dike-disloc_tet4_graded_2000m.cfg timedep.cfg -nodes=<np>

Since the lower material is viscoelastic, this will result in viscoelastic
relaxation following the initial dike opening.
