SCEC Spontaneous Rupture Benchmarks TPV14-2D and TPV15-2D

This directory contains CUBIT journal scripts to generate the mesh
files and PyLith input files to run these two benchmarks for tri3 and
quad4 cell types. Additionally, there are meshes with jumps in cell
size and meshes with smooth gradations in cell size (*_gradient). For
the smooth gradations in cell size, input files are provided to run
the simulations at 25m, 50m, and 100m resolutions.

To run the simulations, several .cfg files must be specified on the
command line.

TPV14-2D, quad4, 100m:

  pylith quad4.cfg tpv14.cfg tpv14_quad4_100m.cfg
