These problems test using physical properties from the SCEC CVM-H with
PyLith via a static problem.

One problem (volume_dislocation.cfg) is a domain 48km x 48km x 16km
with Dirichlet BC imposing shear with slip on a fault.

The second problem (slice_dislocation.cfg) is a domain 256km x 128km x
0.5 km with similar BC. The solution fails to converge due to the
small aspect ratio of the domain, but it samples the velocity model at
shallow depths, which is important for dealing with potential
incompressibility of very soft sediments.
